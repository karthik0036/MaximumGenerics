# MaximumGenerics

# UC-1:<br>

# Given 3 Integers find the maximum<br>

- Ensure to test code with the Test Case.<br>
- To ensure your Code works you need 3
test cases with Max Number at 1st, 2nd
and 3rd<br>
- Use Integer Object and compareTo
UC 1 method to test the maximum number<br>

# UC-2:<br>
# Given 3 Floats find the maximum<br>

- Ensure to test code with the Test Case and
repeat with the similar 3 Test cases in UC 1<br>

# UC-3:<br>

# Given 3 Strings find the maximum

- Ensure to test code with the Test
Case and repeat with the similar 3
Test cases in UC 1<br>

-UC 3 - E.g. Apple Peach Banana<br>

# Refactor-1:<br>
# Refactor all the 3 to One Generic Method and find the maximum<br>

- Ensure the Generic Type extends
Comparable<br>

-Refactor 1 - Make the test case work<br>

# Refactor-2:<br>
# Refactor to create Generic Class to take in 3 variables of Generic Type<br>

- Ensure the Generic Type extends Comparable<br>
- Write parameter constructor<br>
- Write testMaximum method to internally call the static testMaximum method passing the 3 instance variables<br>
- Define new test case to use the Generic Class<br>

#UC-4:
# Extend the max method to take more then three parameters
-Use Options and Sorting<br>

#UC-5:
# Extend the max method to also print the max to std out using Generic Method - Write printMax Generic Method which is internally called from testMaximum<br>
